        "Style tranfer consists in generating an image with the same \"content\" as a base image, but with the \"style of a different picture (typically artistic). This is achieved through the optimization of a loss function that has 3 components: \"style loss\", \"content loss\", and \"total variation loss\":\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The total variation loss imposes local spatial continuity between the pixels of the combination image, giving it visual coherence.\n",
        "*   The style loss is where the deep learning keeps in -that one is defined using a deep convolutional neural network. Precisely, it consists in a sum of L2 distances between the Gram matrices of the representations of the base image and the style reference images, extracted from different layers of a convnet(trained on ImageNet). The general idea is to capture color/texture information at different spatial scales (fairly large scales -defined by the depth of the layer considered).\n",
        "*  The content loss is a L2 distance between the features of the base image (extracted from a deep layer) and the features of the combination image, keeping the generated image close enough to the original one.\n",
